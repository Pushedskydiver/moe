/**
 * Kysely's compile-time table shape. camelCase here matches the app-facing `Ticket` type — the
 * `CamelCasePlugin` (wired in `db.ts`) translates to/from the actual snake_case SQL columns, so
 * this file and the migrations' column names intentionally look different. `claimedBy`/`version`
 * are deliberately absent from the app-facing `Ticket` type (`../ticket.ts`) — they're the
 * atomic-claim primitive's own state (`./claim.ts`), not part of the pure domain shape.
 *
 * `version` is `Generated<number>` because it has a real DB-level `DEFAULT 0` (Kysely's
 * `Insertable<T>` only treats `Generated` columns as optional on insert). `claimedBy` is nullable
 * but deliberately NOT `Generated`, even though an omitted nullable column also defaults to NULL
 * at the SQL level — this keeps "every new ticket explicitly declares itself unclaimed" a visible
 * choice at the insert call site (`tickets-repository.ts`'s `createTicket`) rather than an
 * implicit one.
